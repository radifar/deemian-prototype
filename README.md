# Deemian

A Domain Specific Language for Deep Molecular Interaction Analysis. Warning this is still a prototype/MVP with minimum feature.

## Installation

First create a new environment using Conda, make sure it is using Python 3.10 as currently Deemian only tested on Python 3.10.

```bash
conda create -n deemian-prototype python=3.10
```

Then download the current snapshot of this repository in [zip format](https://github.com/radifar/deemian/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
Extract this zip file in your local computer and enter the `deemian-main` directory, activate `deemian-prototype` environment, and install using pip.

```bash
cd deemian-main
conda activate deemian-prototype
pip install .
```
